  "summary": "Diff implements dark mode via next-themes with a Light/Dark/System toggle in the authenticated user menu, updates global CSS theme tokens for a bold high-contrast palette (light + dark), and adds global heading typography defaults. However, the diff also includes several functional/behavioral changes unrelated to theming (routing/query logic changes, onboarding flow changes, client profile behavior changes), which appear out of scope per the non-goals.",
