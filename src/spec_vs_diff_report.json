  "summary": "The diff largely implements the requested onboarding stabilization: onboarding submission is gated on a stable readiness signal, Enter-key submission is prevented while disabled, and error normalization replaces the literal \"Actor not available\" with a friendly message. However, the diff also introduces additional, broader App initialization/error UI changes and extra error-normalization mappings that were not explicitly requested.",

      "description": "Broader App-level init loading/error UI with retry and normalized error display (not specific to onboarding/actor readiness)",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on stabilizing the Onboard Client flow and onboarding error messaging; the diff adds new global init loading/error screens and retry behavior in App.tsx beyond those requirements.",

      "reason": "REQ-3 only asks to replace user-facing occurrences of the literal \"Actor not available\" with a friendly message; the diff also normalizes multiple other specific backend messages.",
